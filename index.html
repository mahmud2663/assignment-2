                Concept in architecture is an idea, thought, or notion that is the main element that <br>
                drives a design project forward. It is the backbone and foundation of an architectural <br>
                project. The progress of a design depends on its concept. It is the first step a designer <br>
                takes before the start of his/her project. That is why concepts are said to be the seed <br>
                of a project that later on develops into a full-grown tree. A concept doesn’t have to come out <br>
                from a single source of knowledge..</p>
